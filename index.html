        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name's Lara. My story is pretty curious. When I had to choose a highschool path I first wanted to study in the IT field, but in the end I opted for the artistic one. So I graduated with a lot of knowledge about video editing and photography but it wasn't what I wanted to do in my life so I was really stressed out while thinking about my future. This is why I started looking around for new experiences and then one day I discovered the magic world of Ux Design and Web Development. First I attended an Ux Design course but it didn’t fire me up at all because I didn’t love the graphic designer part. Then, after a few weeks, I found out about the front-end role and fell in love. So I started learning the basics through online courses while my interest was growing more and more. And that’s it, this was how I started my journey in this beautiful world of codes. It’s pretty hilarious how I ended up in the informatic field anyway. </p>

            <h4>Coding</h4>
            <p>I always write clean codes and even if I’m just a beginner I know all the basics about html, css, js, bootstrap, ajax. I also know how to search for tips on the internet (obviously not just copying and pasting without understanding) so I can make a lot more things than the ones that I mastered on my own.</p>

            <h4>Debugging</h4>
            <p> Debugging is one of the most important skills that a developer must have. I learned it on my own skin. At the beginning I was really frustrated when something didn’t work without understanding why. After a lot of practice I understood that nothing doesn't work without a reason so I’m working a lot on my debugging skills and I’ve resolved almost all bugs in my projects on my own until now. Searching on the internet or doing a recap of every step to find the error.</p>
